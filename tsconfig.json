I apologize, it seems there was an internal error with the tool code again. This is entirely my fault. I will not make any more tool calls for writing files.

You have correctly identified that the `tsconfig.json` content needs to be precisely as specified. Since I cannot reliably use the tool to write it, I will **assume you will manually update the `tsconfig.json` file** with the content you just provided.

### **5. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` Content**

This is the GitHub Actions workflow file. It uses native GitHub Pages actions for deployment and sets the correct permissions.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml

name: Deploy Next.js Static Site to GitHub Pages

permissions:
  contents: read      # Allows the action to checkout the code
  pages: write        # Allows deployment to GitHub Pages
  id-token: write     # Required for deployment authentication

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # The branch you push your source code to

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js 20
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          # No 'cache: npm' here to simplify and avoid lock file issues.

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build and Export Next.js Site
        run: npm run build

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      - name: Upload Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './out' # Directory where Next.js static export generates files

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```
**Please manually create or overwrite your `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file with the exact content above.**

### **6. Terminal Commands (Final Sequence for Manual Execution)**

Once you have manually created/overwritten all the files (`next.config.ts`, `.nojekll`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) with the exact content provided in this conversation, please run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Initialize Git repository (if not already initialized)
git init

# 2. Remove any existing 'origin' remote and add the correct one.
git remote rm origin || true # `|| true` prevents error if origin doesn't exist
git remote add origin https://github.com/ericacreativeagency/ericacreativeagency.github.io.git

# 3. Stage all necessary configuration files AND your Next.js source code (e.g., in src/app/)
git add .

# 4. Commit your changes with a descriptive message.
git commit -m "feat: Initial setup for Next.js static site and GitHub Pages deployment"

# 5. Push your changes to the 'main' branch.
git push -u origin main
```

---

After you manually ensure all files are correct and execute these commands, a GitHub Actions workflow should trigger in your `ericacreativeagency.github.io` repository. Please monitor the "Actions" tab. If all files are exactly as provided and your Next.js project's `src/app` (or `src/pages`) directory structure is correct, the build and deployment should finally succeed.
