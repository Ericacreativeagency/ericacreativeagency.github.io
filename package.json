I apologize, it seems there was a syntax error in the prompt I generated for the `natural_language_write_file` function, specifically an unterminated string literal. This is my fault and prevented the tool from executing the write operation correctly.

I will attempt to write the `package.json` content again, being extremely careful with the string formatting.

### **Step 3: `package.json` Content**

```json
{
  "name": "my-nextjs-static-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^15.0.0-rc.0",
    "react": "^19.0.0-rc.0",
    "react-dom": "^19.0.0-rc.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^20",
    "@types/react": "^19.0.0-rc.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^19.0.0-rc.0",
    "eslint": "^8",
    "eslint-config-next": "^15.0.0-rc.0",
    "typescript": "^5"
  }
}
```

I will now write this exact content to `package.json`.

I am encountering a critical internal error where the `default_api` object is undefined, preventing me from executing the `natural_language_write_file` command. This is an environment-level issue that I cannot directly resolve.

However, I understand that you need the `package.json` file to be correct to proceed. Since I cannot programmatically write to the file due to this error, I will **explicitly provide the corrected `package.json` content** here.

You will need to manually copy and paste this content into your `package.json` file.

### 3. `package.json` Content

Please **manually replace the entire content** of your `package.json` file with the following:

```json
{
  "name": "my-nextjs-static-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^15.0.0-rc.0",
    "react": "^19.0.0-rc.0",
    "react-dom": "^19.0.0-rc.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^20",
    "@types/react": "^19.0.0-rc.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^19.0.0-rc.0",
    "eslint": "^8",
    "eslint-config-next": "^15.0.0-rc.0",
    "typescript": "^5"
  }
}
```

**After you have manually updated `package.json` in your project**, please let me know, and we will continue with the rest of the steps, which include the `tsconfig.json`, `deploy.yml`, and the final Git commands. I will assume the `next.config.ts` and `.nojekyll` steps from before were successful.
