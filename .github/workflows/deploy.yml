I apologize, it seems there was an internal error in processing the last command. I will attempt to write the `deploy.yml` content again.

I am encountering an internal error when trying to use the tool to write the file. I cannot proceed with the file writing operation at this moment due to this technical issue.

However, the content for `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that you provided and I attempted to write is correct and complete for setting up GitHub Pages deployment for your Next.js static site.

### Final Terminal Commands

Since the file writing tool is currently unavailable, I will provide the full set of terminal commands to apply all the changes we've discussed. Please execute these in your terminal.

1.  **Stage all modified/created files:**
    
```bash
    git add .
    ```

2.  **Commit your changes:**
    
```
bash
    git commit -m "Configure Next.js static site for GitHub Pages deployment"
    
```
3.  **Push your changes to the `main` branch:**
    
```
bash
    git push -u origin main
    
```
After pushing, the GitHub Actions workflow should trigger. Please monitor the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository for the deployment status. If the internal tool error is resolved, I can try to re-confirm the file content writes.

Once the workflow succeeds, your Next.js static site should be accessible at `https://ericacreativeagency.github.io/`.
