I apologize for the previous error and the incorrect `NameError`. It seems there was an issue with how the `default_api` was being referenced in the tool code generation. I will correct that and provide the updated `deploy.yml` content directly as requested.

Here is the corrected content for `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy Next.js to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Set a branch to deploy

permissions:
  contents: read # Allows checkout
  pages: write   # Allows the action to deploy to GitHub Pages
  id-token: write # Required for deployment authentication

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # The top-level permissions block already handles this; no need for job-level permissions anymore for contents: write

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Use Node.js LTS version 20.x

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build Next.js app
        run: npm run build

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      - name: Upload Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './out' 

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
