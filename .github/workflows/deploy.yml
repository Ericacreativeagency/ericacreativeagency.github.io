It seems there was an internal issue when trying to write the file directly. I'm unable to execute the file write operation at this moment.

However, I understand you want to completely replace the content of `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the provided YAML.

Please manually update your `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file with the exact content you provided:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml

name: Deploy Next.js Static Site to GitHub Pages

permissions:
  contents: read      # Allows the action to checkout the code
  pages: write        # Allows deployment to GitHub Pages
  id-token: write     # Required for deployment authentication

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # The branch you push your source code to

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js 20
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' 
          cache: 'npm' 

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build and Export Next.js Site
        run: npm run build 

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      - name: Upload Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './out' 

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

Once you have manually saved this content to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, please proceed with the Git commands to commit and push the changes:

1.  **Stage the corrected file:**
    I am still encountering an internal error when trying to run terminal commands.

Therefore, you will need to execute the following commands manually in your terminal:

1.  **Add the file to staging:**
    
```bash
    git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
    ```

2.  **Commit the changes:**
    
```
bash
    git commit -m "FIX: Corrected YAML syntax and used native Pages deployment actions"
    
```
3.  **Push the changes to your main branch:**
    
```
bash
    git push origin main
    ```

After performing these manual steps, the new GitHub Action workflow should be triggered, and with the correct YAML syntax, your site should deploy successfully.
